Looking at your current Next.js setup, implementing social media tracking and posting is definitely feasible and well-suited to your tech stack! Let me break this down by platform:
Feasibility by Platform:

✅ Facebook & Instagram - Most straightforward
Meta Graph API covers both platforms
Well-documented OAuth 2.0 flow
Comprehensive analytics and posting capabilities
Business accounts get more features

✅ X (Twitter) - Manageable but costly
X API v2 has good documentation
OAuth 2.0 authentication
Caveat: Paid API tiers (Basic $100/month, Pro $5000/month)
Rate limits can be restrictive on lower tiers

⚠️ TikTok - Moderate complexity
TikTok for Business API available
More restrictive approval process
Limited to business/creator accounts
Video upload has specific requirements

✅ BlueSky - Easiest technically
Open AT Protocol
Free API access
Different auth mechanism (app passwords/OAuth)
Smaller user base but growing

Implementation Difficulty: Medium (6-8 weeks)
Your current Next.js + TypeScript + NextAuth stack is perfect for this. Here's why:
NextAuth.js can be extended with custom providers for each platform
API routes can handle webhooks and data syncing
Server-side rendering works well with OAuth flows
TypeScript helps with API response typing
Implementation Steps:
Phase 1: Authentication & Setup (2 weeks)
Apply
UI
Phase 2: Data Fetching & Analytics (2-3 weeks)
Apply
components
Phase 3: Content Posting (2-3 weeks)
Apply
mechanisms
Key Challenges:
Rate Limits - Each platform has different limits
Content Format Differences - Videos vs images vs text length limits
Token Management - Refresh tokens, expiration handling
Webhook Security - Verifying platform webhooks
Compliance - Each platform has posting guidelines
Database Schema Additions:
You'd need tables for:
Connected social accounts
Posted content tracking
Analytics data
Posting schedules
API rate limit tracking
Cost Considerations:
Free: Facebook, Instagram, BlueSky
Paid: X API ($100-5000/month)
TikTok: Free but requires business approval
Would you like me to dive deeper into any specific platform or aspect of the implementation? I can also look at your current authentication setup to see how we'd integrate this.
