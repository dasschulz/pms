# Profile Picture Caching Solution

## Problem

The app was experiencing issues with profile pictures:
- Profile pictures not loading in the navbar
- 410 errors from Airtable URLs (expired/temporary URLs)
- No caching mechanism causing repeated API calls

## Solution

Implemented a client-side caching system with the following components:

### 1. CachedAvatar Component (`src/components/ui/cached-avatar.tsx`)

A replacement for the standard Avatar component that:
- Caches profile pictures in localStorage as base64 data URLs
- Provides 24-hour cache duration
- Handles loading states and fallbacks
- Automatically retries on error and clears invalid cache
- Supports different sizes (sm, md, lg)

### 2. Profile Picture Hook (`src/hooks/use-profile-picture.ts`)

Utility hook for managing cached profile pictures:
- `clearCache(imageUrl)` - Clears cache for specific image
- `clearAllAvatarCache()` - Clears all avatar caches

### 3. Updated Components

- **Navbar** (`src/components/layout/navbar.tsx`): Now uses CachedAvatar
- **Settings Page** (`src/app/einstellungen/page.tsx`): Uses CachedAvatar and clears cache on upload

## Benefits

1. **Reduced API Calls**: Images cached for 24 hours
2. **Better UX**: Loading states and proper fallbacks  
3. **Offline Support**: Cached images work offline
4. **Automatic Cache Management**: Expired entries automatically cleaned up
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to user initials or icon

## Technical Details

- Cache stored in localStorage with prefix `avatar_cache_`
- Images converted to base64 data URLs using HTML5 Canvas
- 1MB size limit to prevent localStorage bloat
- Automatic cache invalidation on image upload
- Cross-origin support for external images

## Usage

```tsx
import { CachedAvatar } from "@/components/ui/cached-avatar"

<CachedAvatar 
  src={imageUrl}
  alt="Profile picture"
  fallbackText={userName}
  size="md"
/>
```
