## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(36, 45%, 70%) or RGB(211, 180, 115), for a balanced, earthy feel that mirrors the party's grounded approach. Its brightness ensures readability on both light and dark backgrounds.
- Background color: HSL(36, 39%, 88%) or RGB(236, 228, 224). The very desaturated shade of the primary gives the page a muted but inviting feeling.
- Accent color: HSL(6, 64%, 57%) or RGB(207, 82, 59) adds contrast without overwhelming the softer primary and background.
- Maintain the default font for a clean and accessible reading experience.
- Use simple, minimalist icons to represent different functions and data points.
- Employ a clean, structured layout that promotes ease of navigation, utilizing either a left sidebar or a bottom home bar for intuitive navigation.
